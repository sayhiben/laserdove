Will you please take a deep dive into this codebase to understand what it does
  and how? There's a good README.md and an AGENTS.md to get you started, and
  there's a decent amount of reference documentation and inspirational code located
  in ./reference/. Please describe the purpose, approach, architecture, structure,
  practice, methodology, and step-by-step instructions for what, how, why, etc.
  this project is and works
